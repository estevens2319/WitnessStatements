Description of the Incident:

I, John Doe, am writing this witness statement in relation to a car accident that 
occurred at the intersection of Elm Street and Oak Avenue in Anytown on 
October 15, 2023.

On the day of the incident, I was driving west on Elm Street, and I had just 
come to a stop at the red traffic light on Elm Street at the intersection with 
Oak Avenue. There were several vehicles in front of me, and we were all waiting 
for the light to turn green.

While waiting at the red light, I observed two vehicles involved in the accident. 
Vehicle A, a blue sedan, was heading north on Oak Avenue, and Vehicle B, a silver 
SUV, was traveling west on Elm Street.

As the traffic light for Oak Avenue turned green, Vehicle A proceeded to cross the 
intersection. At that moment, Vehicle B, which had a red traffic light, entered 
the intersection and collided with the driver's side of Vehicle A.

The impact was substantial, and both vehicles sustained significant damage. I 
immediately pulled over to the side of the road and dialed 911 to report the 
accident. While waiting for the authorities to arrive, I approached both 
drivers to ensure their safety and exchange contact information.

Descriptions of the Vehicles and Drivers:

Vehicle A (Blue Sedan): The driver appeared to be a middle-aged woman with 
brown hair. She seemed shaken but not injured.

Vehicle B (Silver SUV): The driver was a young man in his early 30s. He also 
appeared to be shaken but not visibly injured.

Weather and Road Conditions:

The weather on that day was clear, and the road surface was dry. Visibility 
was not an issue at the time of the accident.

Witnessed Events:

The sequence of events leading up to the accident was as follows:

Vehicle A had the green light to proceed straight on Oak Avenue.
Vehicle B ran a red light while traveling west on Elm Street.
The collision occurred in the intersection.
I was approximately three cars behind Vehicle B and had a clear view of the 
incident as it unfolded. Based on my observation, it is my opinion that the 
driver of Vehicle B was at fault for running the red light.

I am willing to cooperate further if necessary and can provide any additional 
information or testify in court regarding this incident.
