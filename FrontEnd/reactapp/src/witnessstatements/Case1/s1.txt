My name is Amanda Wells. On Tuesday afternoon around 3:30pm, I was walking my dog in the park when I heard a child scream. I looked over and saw a man grabbing a young boy who looked about 10 years old. The boy was yelling "Help, help!" but the man put his hand over the boy's mouth and dragged him towards a white van. He forced the boy into the side door of the van and then got into the driver's seat and quickly drove off. I immediately called 911 to report what I saw. I really hope they find that poor boy.
