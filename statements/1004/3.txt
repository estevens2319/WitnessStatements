My name is Amanda Lopez. I thought I had met a nice man online who cared about me. But he convinced me to travel far from home, took my phone, and forced me to have sex with strangers for money. There were two other girls in the same situation who were always under watch. When we didn't obey, we were beaten and starved. They said if we tried to escape our families would pay. I felt totally trapped and scared until the police raided and rescued us. I'm so thankful but the trauma still haunts me.
