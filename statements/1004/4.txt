My name is Dr. Sarah Mills. I volunteer with an organization providing medical services to human trafficking survivors. The victims we see have extensive trauma from prolonged abuse - physical injuries, malnutrition, PTSD and more. Restoring their health and trust is extremely difficult. Traffickers often deny them healthcare, control them with forced drug use, and leave victims with long-term medical issues. Sadly there are many still suffering in abusive situations with no access to help. We must keep fighting this criminal exploitation.
