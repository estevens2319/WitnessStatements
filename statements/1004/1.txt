My name is Amanda Clark. I manage a motel just off the highway. A few weeks ago, I noticed a room had been booked for over a month under one man's name. However, I saw a different man coming and going from the room with three young women. They rarely ventured out and looked very scared and thin. I thought it seemed suspicious and called the police to report possible trafficking. Officers investigated and found the women had been kidnapped and were being forced into sex work against their will. I'm glad I spoke up before the situation got worse
