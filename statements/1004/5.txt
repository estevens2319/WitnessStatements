My name is Mark Caruso. I'm a social worker that assists human trafficking victims after they escape or are rescued. The psychological impact cannot be overstated. Most deal with severe depression, anxiety, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts from the cruelty inflicted upon them. I help connect survivors to counseling, medical care, housing services and vocational training so they can heal and build a better life. It's a long difficult journey but incredibly rewarding to see their strength and resilience.
