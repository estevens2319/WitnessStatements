My name is Officer James Wilson. I helped raid a motel room where three trafficking victims were being held captive. The young women were lured from vulnerable backgrounds with promises of jobs and security, then transported across state lines and forced into prostitution. The traffickers employed coercion, abuse and controlled their access to food, shelter and medical care. We arrested the ringleaders and provided support services to help the victims. Sadly this is just one example of human trafficking networks exploiting the vulnerable.
