My name is Lisa Chen. I was walking through the park on Tuesday afternoon when I saw a frightening scene. A man in a gray sweatshirt and jeans was forcibly dragging a young boy toward a white van. The boy was screaming "Help me!" but the man put a hand over his mouth and shoved him into the side door of the van. The boy looked about 10 years old with sandy blonde hair. I tried to intervene but the man drove off in a hurry before I could do anything. I immediately took out my cell phone and called the police to report the kidnapping. I really hope they can find the boy and arrest whoever took him. It was an incredibly disturbing thing to witness.
