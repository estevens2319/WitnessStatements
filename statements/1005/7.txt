My name is Jenny Wu. On Wednesday at around 3:15pm, I was at the playground with my son when I noticed some commotion across the park. A man dressed in jeans and a green jacket was pushing a young boy into the back of a red car. The boy was yelling "let me go!" but the man covered his mouth and slammed the door shut. He then got into the driver's seat and quickly drove away. The boy appeared to be around 10 years old with blonde hair. I promptly called the police to report the incident as I feared for the boy's safety.
