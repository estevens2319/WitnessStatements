My name is Kyle Richards. On Wednesday afternoon, I was walking through the park when I saw a young boy being forced into a red sedan. The boy looked around 10 years old with short brown hair and glasses. He was screaming "help me!" as a tall man in a black hoodie grabbed him and shoved him into the backseat of the car. The man then sped off out of the parking lot. I immediately called the police to report the kidnapping and give them a description of the vehicle.
