My name is Jack Wilson. On Tuesday at approximately 3:35pm, I witnessed a kidnapping at the park on Oak Street. I saw a man wearing a black ski mask jump out of a white van, grab a young boy off the sidewalk, and force him into the van. The boy looked about 10 years old with brown hair and was crying for help. I yelled at the man to stop but he drove off quickly with the boy in his van. I called the police immediately and reported the license plate number as ABC-1234. I really hope they find that kid soon. The police need to catch this criminal.
