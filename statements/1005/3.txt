My name is Sarah Davis. I was in the park with my children on Tuesday afternoon when I witnessed a kidnapping. Around 3:30pm, a man in a black hoodie grabbed a young boy who was playing on the swings. The boy screamed "Let me go!" but the man covered his mouth and dragged him toward a white van parked nearby. He forced the boy into the van and drove off quickly. The boy appeared to be about 10 years old with blond hair and was wearing a blue t-shirt. I immediately pulled out my phone, dialed 911, and told them what I saw. I hope the police can rescue that poor child.
