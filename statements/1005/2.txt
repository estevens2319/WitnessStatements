My name is Mark Jones. On Tuesday around 3:45pm, I was driving down Elm Street when I noticed some commotion in the park. I pulled over and saw a man pulling a young boy into a white van. The boy was crying and trying to get away but the man was too strong. He shoved the boy into the van and sped off. I tried to get the license plate number but couldn't see it clearly. The boy looked about 10 years old with brown hair and a red shirt. I called 911 and reported the incident as a likely kidnapping. I hope they find him soon.
