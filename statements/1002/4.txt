My name is Dr. Sarah Mills. I work in the medical examiner's office. The stabbing victim from O'Malley's Pub was brought to our office early this morning. Upon examination, I counted seven deep puncture wounds concentrated in his chest cavity. Two of these severed major arteries near the heart leading to significant blood loss. The pattern of injuries leads me to conclude the attack was intentional and the assailant stabbed with great force multiple times, even after the victim was incapacitated. In my medical opinion, the cause of death was exsanguination and the manner was homicide by stabbing. We collected trace evidence from the wounds to aid in the police investigation.
