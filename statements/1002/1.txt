My name is Amanda Clark. I was at O'Malley's Pub last night and saw the fight break out around 11:30pm. It was horrifying. The man with the knife just went crazy and stabbed the other guy so many times even when he was clearly already seriously wounded. I tried to help the victim while the bartender called 911 but he lost consciousness quickly. The perpetrator ran out of the bar and drove off in a blue sports car at high speed. I didn't get the license plate but remember the car had a distinctive red stripe down the side. I hope he's caught soon before he hurts someone else. The police interviewed all the witnesses at the scene.
