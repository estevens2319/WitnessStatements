My name is Officer Robert Grey. I'm a homicide detective with the city police department. We received a call last night around 11:45pm about a stabbing at O'Malley's Pub downtown. Arriving on scene, I found the victim deceased with multiple stab wounds to the chest. Witnesses described the altercation turning physical and the suspect pulling a knife and attacking the victim. He then fled out the back exit into a waiting getaway car. We have several good leads from witnesses and are reviewing security footage from the area. The crime lab is analyzing evidence collected from the scene. Based on the severity of the attack, I believe we may be dealing with premeditated murder and are following up on that avenue.
