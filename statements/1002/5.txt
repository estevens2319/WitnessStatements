My name is Julie Sanders. I own the building next to O'Malley's Pub. Last night I arrived around midnight to pick something up from my office. As I pulled into the parking lot, I saw a man rushing out the back door of the bar. He had what looked like blood on his shirt and hands. He saw me, looked panicked, and took off running down the street. I then noticed a blue sports car parked in the side alley speed away. I realized something bad must have happened and called the police. I hope my description of the suspect and getaway car can help catch whoever is responsible for this horrible crime.
