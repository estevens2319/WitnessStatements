My name is Mark Wilson. I'm a bartender at O'Malley's Pub downtown. Last night, around 11:30pm, I witnessed a fight break out between two male customers. They were shouting at each other and it quickly turned physical. The taller man slammed the other up against the wall and I saw him pull out a knife from his jacket. Before I could react, he stabbed the other man multiple times in the chest and stomach. Blood was everywhere. The victim collapsed to the ground. I yelled and tried to stop the fight but the suspect then turned and ran out of the bar. I didn't recognize either man and have no idea what the fight was about. The police came but the victim was already dead.
