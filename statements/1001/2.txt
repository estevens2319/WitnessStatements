My name is Jane Johnson. I live at 125 Main St with my husband and two kids. On the evening of October 21st, my family and I went out to dinner around 7pm. When we returned around 10pm, we found the front door wide open and many of our belongings missing - laptops, jewelry, cash. The rooms were completely ransacked. It was devastating. We had just bought a new TV that was stolen as well. I believe the perpetrator must have entered through an unlocked window in the back of the house. I don't know how they got in but they clearly searched every room thoroughly looking for valuables. We are working with the police but have no idea who could have done this.
