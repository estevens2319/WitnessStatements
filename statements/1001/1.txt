My name is John Smith. I live at 123 Main St, right next door to the house that was broken into. On the night of October 21st, around 11pm, I was taking my dog out for a walk when I noticed the front door of my neighbor's house was wide open. This struck me as very odd because my neighbors, the Johnson family, are usually very careful about locking up. As I stood there, I saw a man I didn't recognize come running out of the front door carrying a large bag. He saw me, jumped into a parked car out front and sped off. I tried to get the license plate number but it was too dark. I immediately called the police to report the break-in.
