My name is Lisa Rodriguez. I was driving down Main St around 11pm on October 21st when I saw flashing police lights outside the house at 125 Main. I pulled over and spoke to the police officer on the scene. I explained that around 15 minutes earlier, I had driven down this street and had seen a suspicious parked car with someone sitting in the driver's seat. The car was a dark colored sedan, possibly black or blue. I remember thinking it was odd for a car to be parked there that late at night. Now I wonder if they were waiting to help the burglar escape. I wish I had written down the license plate or model of the car.
