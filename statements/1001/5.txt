My name is Chris Thompson. I am a patrol officer with the city police department. On October 21st around 11:15pm, I received a call about a suspected break-in at 125 Main St. When I arrived on scene, the front door was wide open and the owners confirmed many items were stolen. It appears the perpetrator gained entry through an unsecured window and was able to ransack the master bedroom for valuables. I spoke to several neighbors who provided descriptions of a man fleeing the scene as well as a possible getaway car. We are following up on those leads and collecting physical evidence from the scene. I believe we are making good progress identifying the suspect. This investigation is ongoing.
