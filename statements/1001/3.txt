My name is Robert Williams. I was walking my dog on the night of October 21st around 11:15pm. As I passed by 125 Main St, I noticed movement in the bushes by the side of the house. When I shined my flashlight to get a closer look, I saw a male figure dressed in black quickly duck behind the bush. It looked like he was trying to hide from me. I thought it was very suspicious so I stared for a minute or two but didn't see anymore movement. I continued my walk but kept looking back to the house. A few minutes later, I saw a man come running out the front door and jump into a waiting car before driving off quickly. I regret that I didn't call the police immediately.
