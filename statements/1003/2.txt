My name is Alexandra Davis. I'm a bartender at O'Leary's Pub on Maple Street. Last night one of our regular customers, Robbie Wilson, got very drunk and was acting belligerent. Around 9:15pm we had to cut him off and ask him to leave. He was angry but left without incident. About 15 minutes later, another customer ran in screaming that Robbie was attacking someone outside. I ran out and recognized Robbie straddling and punching someone on the sidewalk. I yelled for help and called the police. Given how intoxicated he was, I suspect Robbie picked a fight with an innocent pedestrian. The whole scene was violent and shocking.
