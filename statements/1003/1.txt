My name is Tyler Jones. I was walking home from work last night around 9:30pm when I turned onto Maple Street and saw a man punching and kicking someone on the ground outside a bar. He was straddling the person and hitting them repeatedly even though they were clearly unconscious. I yelled for him to stop and tried to pull him away but he shoved me off. The attacker was a white male, early 30s, buzzed hair, wearing jeans and a green jacket. I heard sirens approaching so the assailant gave the victim one last kick and then took off running north on Maple. An ambulance arrived shortly after and transported the victim to the hospital.
