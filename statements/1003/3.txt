My name is Officer Kate Rhodes. I'm a patrol officer who responded to an assault outside O'Leary's Pub last night around 9:30pm. When I arrived, the victim was unconscious and bleeding from head trauma. Witnesses identified the perpetrator as Robert Wilson, a patron who had just been kicked out of the bar for intoxication. The victim is another male in his 20s who appears to have been walking by when he was randomly targeted and attacked. We arrested Robbie nearby and charged him with aggravated assault. He has prior arrests for bar fights and domestic violence.
