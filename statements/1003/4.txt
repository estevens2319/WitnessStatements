My name is Dr. Neil Watkins. I treated the victim of last night's assault at Maple Memorial Hospital. The patient presented with a concussion, fractured eye socket, two broken ribs, and facial lacerations. These injuries indicate significant blunt force trauma consistent with being repeatedly punched and kicked in the head and torso. Given the severity of the assault, the victim is lucky their most serious injuries were not life threatening. We will monitor him for complications from the head injury as he recovers.
