My name is Michelle Lewis. I'm the owner of O'Leary's Pub on Maple Street. We strive to maintain a safe, friendly environment for our customers. However, Robbie Wilson has proven to be a threat to public safety through his belligerent, intoxicated behavior. In light of this violent assault, I am permanently banning him from our establishment even once he is released from police custody. I have provided the authorities with security camera footage to aid their investigation. My heart goes out to the random innocent victim who was so ruthlessly attacked just for walking down the street.
